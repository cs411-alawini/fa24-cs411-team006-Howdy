## Project Summary

Our team observed that many people have sleeping issues, and through research, we have found that “50 to 70 million Americans” have “sleep disorders” (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) on government records. As sleep becomes a widespread issue in the country, we wanted to create a website to help people track their sleeping schedules and analyze their sleep patterns to determine their sleep quality. We aim to create a website that can store users' sleeping patterns as well as physical conditions, so we can provide personalized recommendations to each user on how to improve their sleep health. Another feature we aim to achieve is that if a user decides to disregard some of the criteria asked on the website, our program should be able to predict a reasonable range of data for the user based on their input.
We evaluate the wellness of a person’s sleep health through various factors, such as whether a person has slept enough hours for their age group, whether a person falls asleep with a reasonable stress level, or whether a person experiences high blood pressure right before they fall asleep, etc. Our webpage should be designed to display stored sleep health records for each user. In addition, our website will contain text boxes or drop-down menus that allow users to manually enter valid inputs and output results based on users’ desired selection of features.
